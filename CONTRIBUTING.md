4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher (3.10+ recommended for full compatibility)
- Git
- DataStax Astra DB account (optional - for production Cassandra database)

### Installation Steps

#### Option 1: Windows Local Development (Recommended for Windows)
For Windows development without Docker/Cassandra dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StellarMapWeb.git
    cd StellarMapWeb
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install compatible dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install Django==4.2.7 python-decouple==3.8 stellar-sdk==9.3.0 requests==2.31.0
    pip install click==8.1.8 numpy==1.24.3 pandas==2.3.2 tenacity==9.1.2
    pip install aiohttp==3.12.15 django-ratelimit==4.1.0 sentry-sdk==2.38.0
    pip install django-cassandra-engine==1.8.0
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
    ```bash
    copy .env.example .env
    # Edit .env and set:
    # - DJANGO_SECRET_KEY (generate a secure key)
    # - ENV=development (uses SQLite database)
    # - APP_PATH=. (required for Windows paths)
    ```

5. **Generate a Django secret key:**
    ```python
    python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(50))"
    ```
    Add the generated key to your `.env` file as `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`.

6. **Run migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate --settings=StellarMapWeb.settings.settings_local
    ```

    **Migration Details:**
    - Creates all necessary SQLite tables for local development
    - Includes proper indexes for performance optimization
    - Sets up BigQueryPipelineConfig with default settings
    - Creates tables for StellarAccountSearchCache, StellarCreatorAccountLineage, ManagementCronHealth, and StellarAccountStageExecution

7. **Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser --settings=StellarMapWeb.settings.settings_local
    ```
    Follow the prompts to create a username, email, and password.

8. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:5000 --settings=StellarMapWeb.settings.settings_local
    ```

**Windows Setup Notes:**
- Uses SQLite database (no Cassandra/Astra DB required)
- Compatible with Python 3.9+
- BigQuery features disabled (API fallbacks available)
- All core functionality works (search, visualization, lineage display)
- Full admin portal with complete CRUD operations on all data models
- Access at `http://localhost:5000/`
- Admin interface available at `http://localhost:5000/admin/` (requires superuser)

**Admin Portal Features (Development Mode):**
- **BigQuery Pipeline Configuration**: Manage cost controls, pipeline modes, and API settings
- **Stellar Account Search Cache**: View and edit cached search results with filtering and search
- **Stellar Creator Account Lineage**: Browse account lineage data with advanced filtering
- **Management Cron Health**: Monitor cron job health and status tracking
- **Stellar Account Stage Execution**: Track pipeline execution progress with real-time updates
- Full create, read, update, delete operations on all models
- Advanced filtering, search, and data management capabilities

#### Option 2: Full Production Setup (Linux/Mac/Windows with Docker)

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/areveur51/StellarMapWeb.git
    cd StellarMapWeb
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your configuration
    ```

5. **Generate a Django secret key:**
    ```python
    python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
    ```
    Add the generated key to your `.env` file as `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`.

6. **Set up Astra DB:**
    - Create a free Astra DB account at https://astra.datastax.com
    - Create a database and keyspace
    - Download the secure connect bundle
    - Place it in the project root directory
    - Update `.env` with your Astra DB credentials

7. **Run migrations:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

8. **Create a superuser:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

9. **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

### Code Quality Tools

We recommend using these tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Install code quality tools
pip install black flake8 isort

# Format code with Black
black .

# Sort imports with isort
isort .

# Check code with flake8
flake8 .
```

### Django Best Practices

- Keep views simple and focused
- Use Django's built-in security features
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Write clear commit messages

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run tests for a specific app
python manage.py test apiApp

# Run tests with coverage
pip install coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Aim for good test coverage
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use descriptive test names

Example test structure:

```python
from django.test import TestCase

class YourModelTestCase(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Set up test data
        pass
    
    def test_feature_works_correctly(self):
        # Test implementation
        self.assertEqual(expected, actual)
```
