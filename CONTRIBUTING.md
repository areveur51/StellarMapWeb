- Your environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please create an issue with:

- A clear description of the feature
- Why this feature would be useful
- Example use cases
- Any implementation ideas (optional)

### Code Contributions

1. **Choose an issue** or create a new one describing what you plan to work on
2. **Comment on the issue** to let others know you're working on it
3. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
4. **Write your code** following our coding standards
5. **Test thoroughly** before submitting

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

### Code Quality Tools

We recommend using these tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Install code quality tools
pip install black flake8 isort

# Format code with Black
black .

# Sort imports with isort
isort .

# Check code with flake8
flake8 .
```

### Django Best Practices

- Keep views simple and focused
- Use Django's built-in security features
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Write clear commit messages

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run tests for a specific app
python manage.py test apiApp

# Run tests with coverage
pip install coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Aim for good test coverage
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use descriptive test names

Example test structure:

```python
from django.test import TestCase

class YourModelTestCase(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Set up test data
        pass
    
    def test_feature_works_correctly(self):
        # Test implementation
        self.assertEqual(expected, actual)
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you've added or changed functionality
2. **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting
3. **Update the README.md** if needed
4. **Create a pull request** with:
