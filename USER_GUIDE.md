#### Step 3: Set Filters (AND Logic)
All filters are combined with AND logic:
```
Example: Find accounts with balance > 1000 AND home_domain contains "stellar"
Filter 1: xlm_balance > 1000
Filter 2: home_domain contains stellar
```

#### Step 4: Choose Result Limit
Select how many records to return:

- JSON data display for complex fields

**Example Queries:**

**Find wealthy accounts with low trustlines:**
```
Table: lineage
Filter 1: xlm_balance > 10000
Filter 2: trustline_count < 5
Network: public
```

**Find stuck accounts:**
```
Table: cache
Filter 1: status equals PENDING
Filter 2: updated_at < 2025-10-20
Network: public
```

**Find failed pipeline stages:**
```
Table: stages
Filter 1: status equals FAILED
Network: public
```

**Performance Safeguards:**
- Adaptive scan limits prevent runaway queries
- Dense data (lineage, cache): 10x multiplier
- Sparse data (HVA): 100x multiplier
- Network filtering reduces dataset size

Paste your list of accounts into the large text box

#### Step 3: Submit for Processing
Click the submit button to queue all accounts

![Bulk Search Processing Results](docs/screenshots/bulk-search-queued.png)

#### Step 4: Monitor Progress
The system will:
- Validate each address
- Remove duplicates
- Queue valid accounts for processing
- Report invalid addresses
- Show success/error counts

**Results Show:**
- **Valid Accounts** - Successfully queued
- **Invalid Addresses** - Rejected with reason
- **Duplicates** - Removed automatically
- **Total Queued** - How many accounts are processing

**What Happens Next:**
All queued accounts are processed through the pipeline:
1. Account data fetched from Horizon API
2. Creator identified via BigQuery or API
3. Child accounts discovered
4. Lineage stored in database
5. Available for visualization on search page

**Monitoring Progress:**
- Check the Dashboard for processing status
- Search for individual accounts to see results
- Use Query Builder to find pending/completed accounts

**Best Practices:**
- Queue up to 100 accounts at a time
- Check Dashboard for stuck records before large batches

## Tips & Best Practices

### Performance Tips

**1. Use Fresh Cache**
- Results are cached for 12 hours
- First search may take 10-30 seconds
- Subsequent searches are instant
- Check Dashboard for cache status

**2. BigQuery Cost Management**
- Accounts <1 year old use fast BigQuery
- Older accounts use cached database
- Cost limit: $0.17 per query
- Size limit: 2 GB per query
- Pipeline falls back to API if limits exceeded

**3. Bulk Search Efficiently**
- Queue multiple accounts at once
- System processes in background
- Check Dashboard for progress
- Results available when COMPLETED

**4. Optimize Visualizations**
- Use Radial mode for wide trees
- Use Tidy Tree for deep hierarchies
- Adjust spacing for readability
- Fit to window before zooming
- Hide browser dev tools for more space

### Search Tips

**1. Account Address Format**
- Must start with 'G'
- Exactly 56 characters
- Case-sensitive
- Example: `GACJFMOXITSE7Q0L5HNYI2N1AQ4RDHZTGD6FNYK4P5THDVWIKQDG0ODU`

**2. Finding Interesting Accounts**
- Start with HVA Leaderboard
- Explore top-ranked accounts
- Follow lineage branches
- Check Dashboard for recent activity

**3. Network Awareness**
- Always verify network selection
- Public = real data
- Testnet = test data
- Filter Query Builder by network

### Query Builder Tips

**1. Start with Pre-Defined Queries**
- Learn by example
- Understand table structures
- See common patterns
- Modify for your needs

**2. Build Custom Filters Incrementally**
- Start with one filter
- Test results
- Add more filters gradually
- Use AND logic effectively

**3. Manage Result Limits**
- Start with 100 records
- Increase if needed
- Large limits may be slower
- Adaptive scan limits prevent timeouts

**4. Understand Operators**
- `equals` - Exact match only
- `contains` - Partial text match
- `gt/lt` - Numeric comparisons
- Use appropriate operator for data type

### Visualization Tips

**1. Navigation**
- Click any node to explore that account
- Use breadcrumbs to navigate back
- Bookmark interesting trees
- Share URLs with others

**2. Reading the Tree**
- **Center/Root** - Your searched account
- **Parent** - Creator account
- **Children** - Accounts created by target
- **Depth** - Generational distance

**3. Tooltips**
- Hover over any node
- See account details
- View balance and flags
- Quick preview without clicking

**4. Spacing Adjustments** (Tidy Tree)
- Dense trees: Decrease spacing
- Sparse trees: Increase spacing
- Tall trees: Increase vertical
- Wide trees: Increase max distance

### Troubleshooting

**Account Not Found:**
- Verify address is correct (56 chars, starts with G)
- Check network selection
- Account may not exist
- Try searching creator account instead

**Stuck in PENDING:**
- Check Dashboard for alerts
- Pipeline may be processing
- Wait 5-10 minutes and refresh
- Check cron jobs are running

**No Children Shown:**
- Account may not have created any children
- BigQuery limit may have been exceeded
- Child discovery is limited to 100,000 accounts
- Check API fallback was successful

**Query Builder No Results:**
- Verify filters are correct
- Check network filter
- Result limit may be too low
- Table may have no matching records

**Visualization Not Loading:**
- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
